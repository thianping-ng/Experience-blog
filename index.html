              In this week, my team discusss about the redesign of the database

            </p>
            <p>
              So we need to clarify the tables for employee, shift and record
              tables
            </p>
            <p>
              In employee's table will have each individual employee assign with
              an Identification including a shift ID as each employee only have
              1 shift assign to them
            </p>
            <p>
              The shift table keeps track of employee clocking in and out and is
              used to tally with the record table
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence in the record table consist of record ID, employee ID, and
              the actual time of the clocking in for attendance

            <p>
              During Hackaton week, our plan is to set up the rasberry PI up and
              running, have the PI to request user profile. Have the PHP cloud
              server to install, bind these component together. Connect the RFID
              reader with the speaker module to PI, and finally update the
              process

          <div class="get-and-post">
            <p>
              Once rasberry PI has been establish, the PI will communicate with
              the cloud where the database is stored and retrieved via GET and
              POST method. In this simple example, the card tag will pass the
              info via the reader which act as a POST method through a python
              ODBC module and the ability to retrieve via GET method

              Our team colloborate on building a prototype for our sponsor AIDC
            </p>
            <p>
              we've implemented a PI with an attachment of RFID reader and a
              external connection to an AI facial recognition (HuskyLens) which
              is trained to identify user face and giving it an ID, in addition
              to implementing a speaker module that announce the user profile,
              the data is stored and retrieve in the database that is access
              internally in the PI, finally this proves that the information is
              successfully recorded into the database
            </p>
            <p>
              In the final day, after presenting our team project to the
              sponsor. Through the feedback from our sponsor, I learned and
              understand what are the that improvement can be made to the
              project as a prototype, such as including user experience and
              making the product more user-friendly
            </p>
            <p>
              As the scope of the project was to create a solution that capture
              large amount of data in a more efficient and dyanmic approach for
              the company.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through the experience during the Hackathon week, I realize that
              it's not just being unable to deliver our product but unorganized
              in our time management and practices that we need to work on. So i
              believe this issue must be address and improve on in the near

            <p>
              Upon retrieving it, assign the configuration to acces the mysql

              on the website, the system received an error during runtime.
            </p>

            <p>
              The error stated that I've tried to perform a delete operation or
              update on <span>"employee"</span> table which is the parent table
              that has a foreign key relationship with another tabled called
              <span>"record</span> which is the refernce in relationship with
              employee table, which resulted in a foreign key constraint. Due to
              existing record in the database
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="employee-controller">
            <img src="images/delete-from-view.PNG" alt="" />
            <p>
              So in order for me to write a delete function, I've create a
              Delete class in the employee controller which takes in ID as a
              parameter. So Delete class will store a list of employee variable
              called emp which retrieves from GetEmployeeData in the data access
              layer, and upon confirmation of deleting a specific record of the
              employee. The validate anti forgery token ensure that only those
              specific individual can perform such action like deleting a
              employee info from the database.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="sql-query">
            <img src="images/delete-query.PNG" alt="" />
            <p>
              So in the data access layer, I've created a class called Delete
              wich return number of rows that updates or delete records of info
              from the database.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first <span>"query1"</span> delete a employee info from the
              <span>"record"</span>table by their employee ID, where the second
              query <span>"query2"</span> delete a employee info from the
              employee table based on their employee ID.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason why I had to write two query, is that due to foreign
              key constraint in the database where just by deleting a record it
              may affect the employee table as it has a foreign key
              <span>"employee ID"</span> with the record table. In addtion,
              after performing two query transaction variable "rowAffected"
              return the number of updated or deleted rows.

              <p>Otherwise, if the entered field in the search bar is empty it will return nothing. The <span>Tempdata</span>is mechanism for storing a small amount of data for this example I have it only store as boolean, so in this case it will transfer from one controller to a view.</p>

            <p>In the view where the search result return based on the user input for a specific employee record, in this picture is to only show a partial view based on the search result.

          <p>
            In week 16, our team decided to host a private webserver <span>(https)</span> using NGINX in these webserver it can run asp and php simultaneously, where the webserver act as routing to reverse proxy the user request to backend server.

          <div class="employee-page">
            <img src="images/record-search.PNG" alt="">
            <p>
              So in our website where we use asp.net mvc to use as a platform for user interaction, we've implemented a functionality that include a <span>add login</span> for specifically admin to register and have login access to the private server. we've implemented a search record which find record based on employee ID or date, which return empolyee shift timing as a result.

         <div class="shift-page">

              <p>In this section for the front-end portion, I had issues with the background color only loads halfway when returning search result</p>
              <p>Initially it was the footer section issue, so the problem was resolve using <span>height:100vh</span> where the view is vertical height of the viewport and the footer just need to have <span>margin-top:auto;</span> where it will auto align from the page vertical height</p>
          </div>

            <p>So in this pic, shows the resulting problem that I'm currentlyy facing at the moment in these week, so i'll see how i can rectify the issue as this is happening in the body section</p>
            <img src="images/resolve-issue.PNG" alt="">
            <p>Turns out that, the issue lies in the other css called "carousel.css" where the body has a padding bottom causing the footer to float upward</p>

            <div class="recap-assg1">
              <img src="images/recap-of-assg1.PNG" alt="">
              <p>So for this final week of PFD, just a short recap of the component of the prototype product during assignment 1</p>
              <p>1. We used SQlite to store data from the rasberry pi which is a specific component part of the gantry for user data management</p>
              <p>2. We used python console app as our terminal to interact with the system, mostly the prototype operationally ready</p>
              <p>3. website was not incorporated in our product during assignment 1, so there was not user experience for platform to deploy</p>
              <p>4. ganrty (hardware) was not linked to MSSQL database, so mostly the gantry which detect with the HuskyLens for facial recognition and RFID reader to scan and detect key card simultaneously,which identify the user was mostly on the rasberry pi which the pi is running the python language module</p>
            </div>
            <div class="changes-from-assg1">
              <img src="images/changes-from-PFD-assignment_1.PNG" alt="">
              <p>this picture is just to illustrate what are the key changes for our assignment 2</p>
              <p>1. the python console app that we used to program and code and interact through a console based app, having it change to asp.net mvc as a platform for user experience and a website</p>
              <p>So why we used asp.net mvc is that it's easier to manage complex and dynamic solution of an application by model, view and controller allowing full control over the behaviour of an system</p>
              <p>2. SQLite was a temporary solution to storing data from the rasberry pi, so we improvise it to fully integrate with mysql so that with it can be used with asp.net as a web server</p>
              <p>3. added tableau dashboard to illustrate for data visualisation, with it relevant data at hand it can be used for tracking employee performance</p>
              <p>4. added a PHP API server to interface with pi to send and retrieve data from the gantry which is running the rasberry pi (python module)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="in-out-list">
              <img src="images/in-out-list.PNG" alt="">
              <p>for our assignment 2 my team decided to include this component for our product.</p>
              <p>facial recognition for face detection, speaker module to announce username and other particulars about user, asp.net MVC for deployment of website and user experience to allow easier data management for employee attendance tracking or collection of data to interact with, NGINX is a web server (reverse-proxy) handles user request to specific back-end services essential these request are being load-balanced to handle traffic during demand and also to enable communication between server and gantry, lastly tableau for data visulisation to allow understanding of relevant data for the organisation to translate raw data into meaningful data.</p>
              <p>Hence, what is not included are retina scanning, fingerprint scanner, and palm scanner. why because our product is to automate data collection and does not require physical interaction from user</p>
            </div>
            <div class="gantry">
              <img src="images/gantry-hardware.PNG" alt="">
              <p>this picture show the hardware that one of my team mates worked on, so on this rasberry pi it contain the speaker module, RFID reader (long range), potentiometer essentially is to control the speaker volume including the facial recognition not shown in this picture but in the next one, so all of these is what makes up the simulated gantry</p>
            </div>
            <div class="gantry-camera">
              <img src="images/camera-ai.PNG" alt="">
              <p>this is the HuskyLens AI facial recognition in one of the pi component, it's quick to trained and intelligent, it finds the user picture profile that is stored in the database with the unique id assigned to it</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-spec">
              <img src="images/tech-spec.PNG" alt="">
              <p>In this technical specification, of our product gantry and the website asp.net</p>
              <p>MYSql is used as a database to stored and retrieve data from database from the asp.net mvc and is also used by rasberry pi the gantry to communicate</p>
              <p>PHP which is in the server side, PHP API server in terms of application programming interface CRUD operation used for retrieve and write to database</p>
              <p>NGINX is a web server middleware to route traffic from both endpoint which are the gantry and server allowing communication to take place </p>
              <p>Linux as the operation system for rasberry pi which also used python as the programming language for gantry software</p>
              <p>Tableau a software for data visualisation to interpret and understand relevant data</p>
              <p>Lastly asp.net mvc, a programming language using c# and a platform for web application in other words user experience to interact with</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-spec-diagram">
              <img src="images/tech-spec-diagram.PNG" alt="">
              <p>In this techical specification diagram, the basic flow of how this product works is that from the gantry rasberry pi which consist of the gantry component sends request to the router which act as a middleware to traffic those request to the internet and request are handled at the NGINX web server (reverse-proxy) and request is send to the appropriate back-end services such as PHP API server or asp.net mvc to perform CRUD operation into MYSql database. In addition, <span>ubuntu server</span> is a version of ubuntu operating system is lightweight and efficient runs fast, able to run apps quicker it act as a backbone for the server</p>
              <p>aside from the normal traffic, a secure channel which reside in the secure route to send request over the network. So in normal operation tableau send request through SSH traffic towards the router and the router route the request securely to the internet and from there routed to the SSH at the server side to enable communication with MySql database</p>

              <img src="images/website-assg1.PNG" alt="">
              <p>So this is the website my team used for CRUD operation, in this website is used for registering employee, assigning shift to employee and adding employee record into the system. if there is any query in doubt, there is a help / contact us page to input issues regarding the product</p>
