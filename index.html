            <p>add views is a virtual table which is defined by the sql statement query and saving it as an object in the database, a view consist of a set of named columns and row of data. a virtual table references from existing data, a view does not exist to stored set of data value in a database</p>

              <p>views restrict access to certin columns or rows of a table, by creating view I can show relevant information to the employee. hence this enables me to create a autonomous query with views</p>
