            <p>the role I have chosen is databse design</p>
            <p>my role and responsbility is that I'm accountable for design the database based on the <span>data collection use case with views</span></p>
            <p>Views is a virtual table which is defined by the sql statement and saving it as an object in the database, a view consist of a set of named columns and row of data. a virtual table references from existing data, purpose of a view is not the intention to stored as a permanent set of data value in database</p>
            <h2>why used views in database</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Security</li>
              <p>views restrict access to certin columns or rows of a table, by creating view I can show relevant information to the employee. hence this enables me to create a autonomous query with views</p>

                  <p>In this example showscasing a simple draft to create the employee table consisting of name, timing of the shift and actual time when the employee clock in and out</p>
                  <p>and a separate table about record and shift. With "record" table consisting of record ID, employee time with employee ID. Lastly, the table "shift" consisting of shift ID, and shift time</p>
                  <p>This database serve as for read only purpose where users can only access to information relevant to their daily work</p>

          <div class="redo-image">
            <img src="/Experience-blog/images/redo-database-design.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>In this week, my team discusss about the redesign of the database as it wasn't design as expected</p>
            <p>So we need to clarify the tables for employee, shift and record tables</p>
            <p>In employee's table will have each individual employee assign with an Identification including a shift ID as each employee only have 1 shift assign to them</p>
            <p>The shift table keeps track of employee clocking in and out and is used to tally with the record table</p>
            <p>Hence in the record table consist of record ID, employee ID, and the actual time of the clocking in for attendance</p>

          <div class="test-site">
            <img src="/Experience-blog/images/test-data.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Mockaroo is a useful web tool for testing purpose with the intention to test various data type in production so with this tool it will benefit me design my database</p>
            <p>testing realistic data will enable me to discovered errors, bugs in the early phase, in this case testing real data will make my database robust with views as well</p>
