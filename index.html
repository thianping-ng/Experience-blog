            <p>In employee's table will have each individual employee assign with an Identification including a shift ID as each employee only have 1 shift assign to them</p>
            <p>The shift table keeps track of employee clocking in and out and is used to tally with the record table</p>

            <img src="/Experience-blog/images/PFD-obj.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>During Hackaton week, our plan is to set up the rasberry PI up and running,
              have the PI to request user profile. Have the PHP cloud server to install, bind these component together. Connect the RFID reader with the speaker module to PI, and finally update the process
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="get-and-post">
            <p>Once rasberry PI has been establish, the PI will communicate with the cloud where the database is stored and retrieved via GET and POST method. In this simple example, the card tag will pass the info via the reader which act as a POST method through a python ODBC module and the ability to retrieve via GET method</p>
            <img src="/Experience-blog/images/GET&POST.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Our team colloborate on building a prototype for our sponsor AIDC</p>
            <p>we've implemented a PI with an attachment of RFID reader and a external connection to an AI facial recognition (HuskyLens) which is trained to identify user face and giving it an ID, in addition to implementing a speaker module that announce the user profile, the data is stored and retrieve in the database that is access internally in the PI, finally this proves that the information is successfully recorded into the database</p>
            <p>In the final day, after presenting our team project to the sponsor. Through the feedback from our sponsor, I learned and understand what are the that improvement can be made to the project as a prototype, such as including user experience and making the product more user-friendly</p>
            <p>As the scope of the project was to create a solution that capture large amount of data in a more efficient and dyanmic approach for the company.</p>
            <p>Through the experience during the Hackathon week, I realize that it's not just being unable to deliver our product but unorganized in our time management and practices that we need to work on. So i believe this issue must be address and improve on in the near future as it may pose a threat for our final product</p>

              <p>By instantiating EmployeeRecord, is to create a ConfigurationBuilder().SetBasePath() helps to get current directory and adding the AddJsonFile after .SetBasePath, retrieve the mysql database connection through appsettings.json</p>
              <p>Upon retrieving it, assign the configuration to acces the mysql database to a variable called strConn type string. So that any query that we developer want to query to database we can access to strConn</p>
              <p>In addition to creating and retrieving the database connection, I've created a GetEmployeeData class List to retrieve a list of employee from the database. The database will read based on ID, fullname, shiftId, RFID ID and face ID and returns a list of result based on that</p>

            <img src="/Experience-blog/images/week 13.jpg" alt="">
            <p>So basically for week 13, firstly my group will focus on ensuring asp.net is able to perform CRUD operation, such as Create, Update, Delete and Read. Secondly PHP intergrate with PI, Implement security such as HTTPS and JWT so that the asp.net is not vurnerable to attacks. Lastly ensure communication is establish for PI and tableau, and set those task on cloud.</p>

            <img src="/Experience-blog/images/sql-delete-error.PNG" alt="">
            <p>Upon performing the sql delete query for the delete functionality on the website, the system received an error during runtime.</p> 
              
            <p>The error stated that I've tried to perform a delete operation or update on <span>"employee"</span> table which is the parent table that has a foreign key relationship with another tabled called <span>"record</span> which is the refernce in relationship with employee table, which resulted in a foreign key constraint.

          <div class="employee-controller">
            <img src="/Experience-blog/images/delete-from-view.PNG" alt="">
            <p>So in order for me to write a delete function, I've create a Delete class in the employee controller which takes in ID as a parameter. So Delete class will store a list of employee variable called emp which retrieves from GetEmployeeData in the data access layer, and upon confirmation of deleting a specific record of the employee. The validate anti forgery token ensure that only those specific individual can perform such action like deleting a employee info from the database.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="sql-query">
            <img src="/Experience-blog/images/delete-query.PNG" alt="">
            <p>So in the data access layer, I've created a class called Delete wich return number of rows that updates or delete records of info from the database.</p>
            <p>The first <span>"query1"</span> delete a employee info from the <span>"record"</span>table by their employee ID, where the second query <span>"query2"</span> delete a employee info from the employee table based on their employee ID.</p>
            <p>The reason why I had to write two query, is that due to foreign key constraint in the database where just by deleting a record it may affect the employee table as it has a foreign key <span>"employee ID"</span> with the record table. In addtion, after performing two query transaction variable "rowAffected" return the number of updated or deleted rows.</p>
